The super() function in Python makes class inheritance more manageable and extensible. The function returns a temporary object that allows reference to a parent class by the keyword super.

The super() function has two major use cases:

To avoid the usage of the super (parent) class explicitly.To enable multiple inheritances​.

CodeSingle inheritance

Consider the example below, where the parent class is referred to by the super keyword:

class Computer(): def __init__(self, computer, ram, storage): self.computer = computer self.ram = ram self.storage = storage # Class Mobile inherits Computer class Mobile(Computer): def __init__(self, computer, ram, storage, model): super().__init__(computer, ram, storage) self.model = model Apple = Mobile('Apple', 2, 64, 'iPhone X') print('The mobile is:', Apple.computer) print('The RAM is:', Apple.ram) print('The storage is:', Apple.storage) print('The model is:', Apple.model)

What is super() in Python?

Edpresso Team

The super() function in Python makes class inheritance more manageable and extensible. The function returns a temporary object that allows reference to a parent class by the keyword super.

The super() function has two major use cases:

To avoid the usage of the super (parent) class explicitly.To enable multiple inheritances​.

CodeSingle inheritance

Consider the example below, where the parent class is referred to by the super keyword:

1

class Computer():

2

def __init__(self, computer, ram, storage):

3

self.computer = computer

4

self.ram = ram

5

self.storage = storage

6

​

7

# Class Mobile inherits Computer

8

class Mobile(Computer):

9

def __init__(self, computer, ram, storage, model):

10

super().__init__(computer, ram, storage)

11

self.model = model

12

​

13

Apple = Mobile('Apple', 2, 64, 'iPhone X')

14

print('The mobile is:', Apple.computer)

15

print('The RAM is:', Apple.ram)

16

print('The storage is:', Apple.storage)

17

print('The model is:', Apple.model)

In the example above, Computer is a super (parent) class, while Mobile is a derived (child) class. The usage of the super keyword in line ​10 allows the child class to access the parent class’s init() property.

In other words, super() allows you to build classes that easily extend the functionality of previously built classes without implementing their functionality again.

Multiple inheritances​

The following example shows how the Super() function is used to implement multiple inheritances.

computer, a file system -- sometimes written filesystem -- is the way in which files are named and where they are placed logically for storage and retrieval. Without a file system, stored information wouldn't be isolated into individual files and would be difficult to identify and retrieve. As data capacities increase, the organization and accessibility of individual files are becoming even more important in data storage.

Digital file systems and files are named for and modeled after paper-based filing systems using the same logic-based method of storing and retrieving documents.

File systems can differ between operating systems (OS), such as Microsoft Windows, macOS and Linux-based systems. Some file systems are designed for specific applications. Major types of file systems include distributed file systems, disk-based file systems and special purpose file systems.

Multiple Inheritance in Python

Inheritance is the mechanism to achieve the re-usability of code as one class(child class) can derive the properties of another class(parent class). It also provides transitivity ie. if class C inherits from P then all the sub-classes of C would also inherit from P.
 

Multiple Inheritance 
When a class is derived from more than one base class it is called multiple Inheritance. The derived class inherits all the features of the base case.

the coming section, we will see the problem faced during multiple inheritance and how to tackle it with the help of examples.
 

The Diamond Problem
 

" style="max-width: 100%; display: block !important; object-fit: contain;">

It refers to an ambiguity that arises when two classes Class2 and Class3 inherit from a superclass Class1 and class Class4 inherits from both Class2 and Class3. If there is a method “m” which is an overridden method in one of Class2 and Class3 or both then the ambiguity arises.

MySQL Tutorial Point; You will learn how to use MySQL statements like SELECT, INSERT INTO, UPDATE, DELETE with examples.

Here, We will describe about the MySQL most used statement. we would love to share with you how insert or delete/remove single or multiple rows into MySQL database table, how to select or update data into MySQL database table.

The most commonly used statement of MySQL Select statement. MySQL SELECT statement used to fetch data/records from database table.In the INSERT INTO statement of MySQL, you can insert single or multiple rows into the database table.MySQL UPDATE statement, you can update the single row using the UPDATE & WHERE clause statement at a time.The DELETE statement is used to remove/delete a specific row or multiple rows using the MySQL DELETE & WHERE clause.Table Of ContentSELECT Statement MySQLINSERT Statement MySQLUPDATE Statement MySQLDELETE Statement MySQLSELECT Statement MySQL

In MySQL, The SELECT statement is the most commonly used MySQL statement. You can use the SELECT statement to fetch or get data from one or more tables within the database. With SELECT statement of MySQL, you can fetch all fields of table or specified fields.

Syntax

In MySQL SELECT statement syntax is :-

SELECT field1, field2 … field n FROM Table [WHERE conditions]; ParamsFields :- It’s a database column name. You can fetch one or more fields using SELECT statement.Table :- It’s a database table name.WHERE :- It’s a option. If You want to filter some data that time specify any condition using the WHERE clause.SELECT Statement Example SELECT users.id, users.name, users.age FROM users WHERE status = active;INSERT INTO Statement MySQL

In MySQL, You can use the INSERT INTO statement to insert data to your database table. With INSERT INTO statement of MySQL, you insert single row or multiple rows into database table

MongoDB is an open-source document-oriented database that is designed to store a large scale of data and also allows you to work with that data very efficiently. It is categorized under the NoSQL (Not only SQL) database because the storage and retrieval of data in the MongoDB are not in the form of tables. 

The MongoDB database is developed and managed by MongoDB.Inc under SSPL(Server Side Public License) and initially released in February 2009. It also provides official driver support for all the popular languages like C, C++, C#, and .Net, Go, Java, Node.js, Perl, PHP, Python, Motor, Ruby, Scala, Swift, Mongoid. So, that you can create an application using any of these languages. Nowadays there are so many companies that used MongoDB like Facebook, Nokia, eBay, Adobe, Google, etc. to store their large amount of data.
